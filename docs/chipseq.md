# ChIP-SEQ experiment

**ChIP-sequencing** is a molecular biology technique used to detect **protein interactions with DNA**. <br>
ChIP-seq stands for: **Ch**romatin **I**mmuno **P**recipitation followed by massively parallel DNA **Seq**uencing. 
<br>It allows to detect the binding sites of DNA-associated proteins at nucleotide level. <br>
The proteins targeted in such analysis are typically transcription factors, modified histones, polymerases or proteins able to chemically modify DNA or histones.
