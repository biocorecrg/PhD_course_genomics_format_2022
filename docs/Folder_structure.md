# The project folder structure and finalizing the project
Let's explore the project folder we have created using commands **ls** and **cd**.
To finalize the project, go back to the main README.txt and append it with new information about the project.


Open README.txt in the editor and write down what this folder contains and what are the steps of the ChIP-seq data analysis.
Make sure to save your file before existing the editor.

Another way to append lines in the existing file is to use command **cat** and redirection **>>**:

```{bash}
cat >> README.txt
1. I learned today how to write RAEDME files.
2. I will always write README.
3. I will name my folders and files using the date as a prefix, using the format YYYY-MM-DD. 
```
Use the keys Enter and then Ctr-D to get out of cat.
Explore your new file using **more**.
